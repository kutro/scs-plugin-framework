# SCS Plugin Framework

`scs-plugin-framework` is a modern, feature-rich C++20 framework for creating plugins for SCS Software's truck simulators (Euro Truck Simulator 2, American Truck Simulator).

This project is a modernized and extended version of the original `hry-core` framework. It aims to provide a more robust, flexible, and easier-to-use foundation for plugin development.

## Features (Planned)

*   **Full C++20 Support:** Leveraging the latest C++ standards for cleaner and more efficient code.
*   **Up-to-date Dependencies:** Using the latest versions of core libraries like ImGui, spdlog, and others.
*   **Comprehensive Telemetry:** Full support for the latest SCSSDK, providing access to all available data channels from the game.
*   **Enhanced API:** A refactored and improved API for easier plugin development.
*   **Built-in Testing:** Integrated unit tests to ensure framework stability.
*   **Modern CMake:** A clean and maintainable build system.

## Acknowledgements

This project would not be possible without the foundational work done by **Piotr Krupa (Hary309)** on the original [hry-core](https://github.com/Hary309/hry-core). We are grateful for his contribution to the SCS modding community.
